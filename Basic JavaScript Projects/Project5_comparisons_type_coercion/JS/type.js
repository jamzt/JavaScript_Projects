document.write(typeof "Tesla")  //this operator gives data a type of variable. this one is to get string
document.write(typeof 55); // this operator is to get number type of data
document.write("100" + 2); // this will return 1002 because 100 is a string and 2 is a number. JavaScript still performes the operation and returns an output it's called COERCION, while other programming langauges give error
